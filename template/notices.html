			<h3>Business Screen Layout Change - Tuesday 27 January 2015</h3>
				<p>When coming from 'Submit Taxes' for businesses, you will be directed to a new
				screen layout to pay taxes for businesses, similar to that of the new property screen layout. The menus that were on the left hand side will
				now be layed out horizontally near the top of the screen. <u>All the same functionality is still present</u>. This is to make effective
				use of smaller tablet screen sizes. Also some of the fields that were displayed have been deprecated.</p>

			<h3>New Payments Screen + Reverse Payments - Tuesday 27 January 2015</h3>
				<p>From the top menu of both the business and property pages, there is a 'payments' link. This shows
				payments that are processed in sequential order by date processed. Notice there is a running balance for
				each business and property. If there is an overpayment in one transaction, it will be carried over (carried forward) into the
				next transaction. Notice that each Business and Property will have a credit balance displayed at the top of the page. This will
				be the same as 'carried forward' amount in the last transaction processed.<p/>
				There is also a 'Reverse Payments' button to undo transaction entries entered, however it is only available
				to super users. Any reversals made will be logged. Please do not use the old 'reverse payments' page. (I will be removing that link )</p>

			<h3>Outstanding Invoices - Tuesday 27 January 2015</h3>

			<h3>Document uploading problem - Tuesday 27 January 2015</h3>
				<p>The image uploading still relies on some old code which contained a bug preventing images to
					be uploaded for property receipts for all users other than super users. I have modified this code
					and should be working properly. Please let me know if there are still issues.</p>
